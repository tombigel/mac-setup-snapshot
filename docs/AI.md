## Project Contract

Mac Setup Snapshot helps rebuild a Mac by creating a YAML setup snapshot and performing an additive restore. It must be safe to run on a clean Mac and clear about every action it is about to take.

## Key Workflows

- `prepare`: check/install prerequisites.
- `restore`: run prepare preflight, then restore the setup snapshot.
- `continue`: resume from `~/.mac-setup/resume.yml`.
- `status`: inspect resume state.
- `backup`: generate setup snapshot.

Use `--appstore-login=skip|prompt|pause|require` when testing App Store flows. Never ask for or store Apple ID credentials.

Backup writes `mac-setup.backup.yml`, `backup-list.md`, and `README.md` for local and iCloud targets. The Markdown list and README must stay free of copied dotfile contents, secrets, tokens, and raw command output.

Use `--report`, `--report-format`, and `--skip-report` when validating process-report behavior. Reports must summarize outcomes without storing secrets, copied dotfile contents, tokens, or raw command output.

## Safety Checklist

- No destructive cleanup.
- No unbounded package-manager calls.
- No direct `curl | sh`.
- No secrets in logs, docs, tests, setup snapshot examples, or resume files.
- dry-run mode must not mutate user state.
- Resume files must contain only workflow metadata.

## Testing Guidance

Use Bats and mocked commands. Do not call real package managers in tests.

Managed/sandboxed agent shells may not load the user's interactive shell profile, so Homebrew tools can be installed but missing from `PATH`. On Apple Silicon Macs, run validation with Homebrew paths injected explicitly:

```bash
PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH" shellcheck bin/mac-setup lib/*.sh lib/sources/*.sh
PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH" /opt/homebrew/bin/bats test
```

If `bats` is not found by name, check standard locations before reporting it missing:

```bash
ls -l /opt/homebrew/bin/bats /usr/local/bin/bats
```

Do not assume a missing executable from plain `command -v` means the tool is not installed; first account for sandbox PATH differences. When reporting validation, include the exact command and PATH used.

Timeout tests must not run real slow commands inside full CLI flows. Avoid `sleep 5` or long-running child processes in Bats unless the test runner itself has a hard fail-timeout. Test timeout plumbing by stubbing the timeout wrapper or by direct helper-level tests that return immediately. Full `backup`/`restore` tests should mock package-manager outcomes, not exercise process-killing behavior.

Useful smoke checks:

```bash
mac-setup prepare --dry-run
mac-setup restore --source local --dry-run
mac-setup status
mac-setup continue --dry-run
```

## Risky Areas

- Dotfile restore and path confinement.
- iCloud endpoint preflight, history, and macOS privacy guidance.
- Gist upload and token handling.
- Homebrew bootstrap and installer download.
- `mas` hanging when App Store is not signed in.
- App Store inventory normalization and stale/duplicate `mas list` entries.
- Manual app de-duplication against App Store receipts and Homebrew casks, including punctuation-normalized cask names such as `firefox@nightly`.
- Not-yet-installed Homebrew cask replacement candidates for standalone manual apps, including `brew info --cask` validation to avoid fuzzy search false positives.
- Restore prompting/install behavior for manual app `brew_cask_candidate` values.
- App Store login policy interactions with Xcode restore.
- Process report accuracy and secret-free output.
- Xcode CLT GUI prompts.
- Resume-state consistency after interruption.
